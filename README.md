This tool evaluates the input signal, applying tailored harmonics and filtering to enhance the audio.
The extent of sound enrichment is dynamically influenced by the user's performance. 
Real-time audio signal adjustments provide musicians with a fresh avenue for self-expression during their performances.

This tool allows you to add specific harmonics to guitar signal. 

Firstly the signal is being analyzed, after that program adds specific tones to the signal. 
The program responds to the guitar playing's force along with increasing playing dynamics, and it begins to add more and more tones to the signal.
So the louder you play the more tones are beign added to the signal.
